JWT
in order to decode the JWT token go to jwt.io and paste the token
use secret key to verify the valid or invalid signature

Authorization header contains bearer spaces token

GENERATE SECRET KEY
type node in terminal, write cryto  then  crypto.randomBytes(64).toString('hex')

Access token goes to local storage, refresh token goes to cookies
not putting refresh token in local storage , it is because local storage is very suseptible to
 XSS attacks

 XSS - cross site scripting vulnerability,

 XSS can also access cookies , but we keep cookies safe by introducing a flag named as httponly cookie
 httponly cookie cannot be accessed by javascript , therefore httponly cookies can only be accessed
 by their servers only

 we cant put accesstoken in cookies , it is because it cant be accessed by javascript, as we need to
 access the the token in order to check whether user is logged in or not

 //COOKIES
 Cookies are bits of information that used by server , to store info in the frontend, which makes sure
 that the data coming to the frontend is a valid data


 CORS
 cross origin resource sharing...,
 whenever you need to share data between resources and the resources is located at different
 locations , need to use CORS

 try to watch the axios documentation, baseURL if not properly written, it will give error
const axiosClient = axios.create({
    // we can define the baseURL here , so that we dont have to write or repeat it again
    // it should baseURL.., dont mis spell it , it will give error
    baseURL: "http://localhost:7000/api",
    //   without withCredentials cookies wont be send from frontend to backend
    withCredentials: true,
  });
  export default axiosClient;

  INTERCEPTORS
  two interceptors request and response interceptors


  after doing the process.env restart the client and server app

  {/* Provider can be written inside or outside the BrowserRouter, they are independent to each other
